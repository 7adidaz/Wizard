    "article": "'Exactement,' says Joni Mitchell, happy that, after several hours of conversation and half a pack of cigarettes, I get it — at least this point anyway. “All my battles were with male egos,” she says. “I’m just looking for equality, not to dominate. But I want to be able to control my vision. There are those moments when I wax feminine and I get walked on.” We’d been talking about record executives, and exes, and fussy by-the-book musicians who wouldn’t do what she wanted. “Basically, at this time, I’m trying to fix my legacy. It’s been butchered. It’s been panned, and scanned, and colorized.” To her several-million-strong crowd of fans, that might seem a strange notion. But exactly how she is celebrated is of special importance to her. To hear her tell it, most of her life has been spent in a state of revolt against other people’s nonsensical ideas about how she should think or dress, what she should believe, and how she should play music. She mentions the guy her record company sent not long ago — “the burglar,” she calls him — to root around her storage unit to cobble together a boxed set she calls a “turd,” which she eventually got killed. She started the process over herself, the result being the booklike package sitting on the table between us: four discs, 53 songs, a thematically and not chronologically arranged memoir in music and words, exactly four hours long, called Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, a Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced. It would be one long dance.  Mitchell was never at the top of the pops, exactly, yet her music, and some idea or memory of her, has endured. It can be difficult to be someone so famous — and so famously beautiful — and not feel the pressure of the sediment of time, to not be trapped in the amber of cultural memory. But her defiant relationship to her fame, her unwillingness to allow herself to be defined or even fully claimed by others, is precisely what has made her such a talismanic figure for so many, and for so long. Taylor Swift recently wanted to play her in a movie."
