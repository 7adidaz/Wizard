### what is the best way to use the extension? 
- Don't try to summarize videos that are longer that 20 mins (it will just make you wait, then crash!).
- Article summary only works for websites with `<article>` tag only (we extract the article from the tag and it's children).
- for all text related services, don't try to put text that is longer than 2500 character, it will just reject the request!
